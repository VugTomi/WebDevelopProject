# Star Wars Themed Website
*(University Basic Web Developing Course Submission)*

This project was developed approximately a year ago as part of the requirements for my **Business Informatics** studies, specifically for the Web Design and Development practical course.

**Please Note:** The content and text within the website are primarily in **Hungarian**.

**Project Goal:**
To demonstrate foundational skills in **HTML5**, and **CSS3**.

**Status and Context:**
This project reflects the level of my skills at the time of submission to the university. The code has not been actively maintained or updated since then, and it is preserved here in its original form.
